# KickStart 🚀

**KickStart** is a unified CLI tool to bootstrap projects across multiple tech stacks using **one simple command**.

Stop remembering different project creation commands.  
KickStart provides a **single, consistent, CLI-first experience** with opinionated, production-ready project structures.

## ✨ Vision

Developers waste time remembering and switching between:
- `npm create vite@latest`
- `flutter create`
- `npx react-native init`

**KickStart solves this** by offering:
> One command. Any stack. Clean structure.
