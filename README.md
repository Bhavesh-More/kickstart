# KickStart 🚀

KickStart is a unified project scaffolding CLI that lets you bootstrap projects
across multiple tech stacks using a single command.

## Vision
Stop remembering different project creation commands.
Use one CLI to scaffold projects with opinionated, production-ready structures.

## Features
- Single command project creation
- Multiple frameworks support (React, Flutter, Node, etc.)
- Predefined folder structures (dashboard, MVC, clean architecture)
- CLI-first developer experience

## Installation
```bash
npx kickstart
