# KickStart

**KickStart** is a unified CLI tool to bootstrap projects across multiple tech stacks using **one simple command**.

Stop remembering different project creation commands.

## ✨ Vision

Developers waste time remembering and switching between:
- `npm create vite@latest`
- `flutter create`
- `npx react-native init`
- `create-expo-app`

**KickStart solves this** by offering:
> One command. Any stack. Clean structure.

- Supports multiple frameworks:
  - React
  - Flutter
  - React Native (Expo & Community CLI)
- Interactive CLI with arrow-key navigation

No installation needed. Run directly using `npx`:

```bash
npx create-kickstart
